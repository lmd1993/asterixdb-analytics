Pregelix
========

Pregelix is an open-source implementation of the bulk-synchronous vertex-oriented programming model (the Pregel API) for large-scale graph analytics. Pregelix is based on an iterative dataflow design that is better tuned to handle both in-memory and out-of-core workloads efficiently. Pregelix supports a variety of physical runtime choice which can fit different sorts of graph algorithms, datasets, and clusters. Our motto is "Big Graph Analytics Anywhere" --- from a single laptop to large enterprise clusters.
